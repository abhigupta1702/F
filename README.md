F: A JavaScript Component Framework
=

##F helps you build large, modular apps.
With easy data binding, view showing/hiding, and dead simple inheritance.

##F doesn't reinvent the wheel.
Using Backbone, jQuery, and Handlebars, F provides a simple way to modularize large applications.

##F inherits.
F provides an inheritance model, Class. Based on Douglas Crockford's new_constructor, Class lets you create building blocks and extend them, complete with access to super methods and constructor chaining.
